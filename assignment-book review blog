    <center><h2>Book Review: To Kill a Mockingbird</h2></center>
    <center><h3>Author: Harper Lee</h3></center>
    <center><h3>Genre: Fiction</h3></center>
    <center><h3>Rating: 5/5</h3></center>
    <center><h3>Review:</h3></center>
    <center><p>To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee centres on Atticus Finch's attempts to prove the innocence of Tom Robinson, a black man who has been wrongly accused of raping a white woman in 1930s Alabama. The novel is narrated by Finch's daughter, Scout, who provides a child's perspective on the events that unfold in the story.
        In many ways, this book is a great example of how literature can both teach and delight, which makes it a great book for a budding novelist to read. Another thing worth analyzing from a fiction-writing perspective is how Scout personally handles the issues that are going to be raised in the book.
